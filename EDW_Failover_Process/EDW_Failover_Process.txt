1. SqlAgent has been stopped on \\SeapSqlEdw03 and \\SeapSqlEdw04 to reduce the load and inflight transactions on the servers.
2. AG SQLEDWU has been changed to sync mode between \\SeapSqlEdw03 and \\SeapSqlEdw04.



Next Steps:
1. Watch the AG redo queue on \\SeapSqlEdw03 for AG SQLEDWU
2. Once the redo queue has pretty much dissipated and \\SeapSqlEdw03 and \\SeapSqlEdw04 are in sync for this AG, then failover AG SQLEDWU to \\SeapSqlEdw03.
3. Reboot \\SeapSqlEdw04.
4. Wait for AG SQLEDWU to come in sync between \\SeapSqlEdw03 and \\SeapSqlEdw04.
5. Once the redo queue has dissipated for AG SQLEDWU, then failback SQLEDWU from \\SeapSqlEdw03 to \\SeapSqlEdw04.
6. Make sure all databases come online in AG SQLEDWU on \\SeapSqlEdw04.
7. Check with EDW team in Slack before starting SqlServerAgent again on \\SeapSqlEdw03 and \\SeapSqlEdw04.
8. Make AG SQLEDWU async again between \\SeapSqlEdw03 and \\SeapSqlEdw04.
